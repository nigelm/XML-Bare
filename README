XML::Bare
Version 0.06
------------

INSTALLATION
  Download XML-Bare-0.06.tar.gz and untar it:
    % tar -xzf XML-Bare-0.06.tar.gz
    
  Follow the standard steps for making and compiling a perl module:
    % cd XML-Bare-0.06
    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make
    % make test
    % make install

MODIFICATION
  The standard distribution of this library includes a
  precreated XML-Bare_wrap.c file. This file is a wrapper
  for the C++ library so that it can interface with Perl. It
  was created using Swig from the XML-Bare.i specification
  file.
  
  If you need to modify the parser enough that the specification
  file needs to be changes you will need to recreate the wrapper
  file.
  
  Assuming you have Swig installed, you can use the following
  to do so:
    % swig -perl5 -module XML::Bare XML-Bare.i
    
  Note that using the above command will wipe out the current
  Bare.pm. The one included in the distribution is a not
  just the swig code; it includes all of the custom module
  code as well.
  
  All of the custom code will need to be manually inserted
  into the newly generated Bare.pm file. ( presumably by
  copying and pasting from the original Bare.pm included
  with the dist )
