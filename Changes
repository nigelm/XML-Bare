XML::Bare Changelog

0.10 ( 6-21-07 )
  - Made XS routines 30% more efficient. Speed of parsing and perl hash creation
    is now very good in comparison to all currently available alternatives in perl.

  - Rewrote library using XS instead of swig.

0.08 ( 6-20-07 )
  - Parser has been rewritten in C to avoid dependency on g++.
  - After node parsing C tree structure memory is now freed.

0.07 ( 6-19-07 )
  - Modified custom script because it was incorrect in its use of redirection, causing
    some platforms to fail to compile.

0.06 ( 6-17-07 )
  - Modified Makefile to use custom script to switch between g++ and gcc for
    compilation. Even as c, swig interface still did not compile properly with

0.05 ( 6-16-07 )
