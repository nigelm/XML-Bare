XML::Bare Changelog

0.21
  - Comments are no longer completely ignored. One comment
    node is recognized and stored per non immediate node.

0.20 ( internal )
  - forcearray function has been added
  - simplify function has been added
  - croak now used to error out of an improper call to find_node
  - obj2xml has been corrected; previously newlines would stack
    up at the end of the xml file
    
0.17 ( internal - unstable )
  - Merge updated to handle array and overlap properly
  - del_by_perl function has been added
  - add_node modified to return the added node
  - find_node modified to skip blank values
  - Previously a set of nodes could not be printed out using
    the 'xml' function. This can now be done. ( see perldoc )

0.16 ( internal )
  - Mixed XML is now supported.
  - UTF8 is now parsed properly.

0.15 ( internal )
  - C Parser has been revised greatly in order to make it faster. Internal
    state engine has been rewritten using gotos instead of a switch in order
    make each state more independent and easily optimized by the compiler.

0.14 ( internal )
  - Code that creates Perl hash from parsed XML structure has been
    rewritten in XS instead of Perl. As a result overall speed has been
    increased by 40% or so.

0.13 ( internal )
  - Code that creates Perl hash from parsed XML structure has been
    cleaned up in order to avoid use of a temporary Perl hash.

0.12 ( internal )
  - 'find_node' and 'del_node' functions are now exportable.
  - 'find_node' function will now work properly if called on a single item
    instead of a list of items.
  - Added 'find_by_perl' function to select nodes from a list that match
    a specific perl expression.
  - A performance test script and some xml files are now included and example runs of 
    the test script are in the documentation. XML::Bare is ~14-80 times
    faster than the alternatives.

0.11 ( 6-25-07 )
  - Changed XS code so that it is backwards compatible with older versions of Perl.
  - Changed XS code to use 'blind' pointers, a custom created Perl Scalar. Speed
    is increased as a result for XML with large contiguous values.

0.10 ( 6-21-07 )
  - Made XS routines 30% more efficient. Speed of parsing and perl hash creation
    is now very good in comparison to all currently available alternatives in perl.

0.09 ( 6-20-07 )
  - Rewrote library using XS instead of swig.

0.08 ( 6-20-07 )
  - Parser has been rewritten in C to avoid dependency on g++.
  - After node parsing C tree structure memory is now freed.

0.07 ( 6-19-07 )
  - Modified custom script because it was incorrect in its use of redirection, causing
    some platforms to fail to compile.

0.06 ( 6-17-07 )
  - Modified Makefile to use custom script to switch between g++ and gcc for
    compilation. Even as c, swig interface still did not compile properly with
    g++ on some systems.

0.05 ( 6-16-07 )
  - Ceased using c++ for swig interface; it caused compilation issues on some platforms
  - Fix further output indentation issues due to {value} always being displayed.
    {value} is now displayed as documented.
  - First line of changes was incorrect previously

0.04 ( 06-15-07 )
  - Added clean function
  - Added merge function
  - Bugfix: xml output indentation was off due to parser changes in 0.03
  - Updated documentation

0.03 ( 06-14-07 )
  - Modified makefile to work under windows with Activestate and MSVC
  - Cleaned up parser some and fixed basic mixed xml
  - Added changelog to dist
  - Dist now created from MakeMaker 6.32 ( license and abstract add to Meta.yml )

0.02 ( 06-13-07 )
  - Changed version line in perl module from my to global to allow proper cpan indexing

0.01 ( 06-13-07 )
  - First release
